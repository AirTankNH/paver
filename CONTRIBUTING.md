### Suggesting Enhancements

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues][first] - issues that should be easy to get started and be quick to complete.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues that may be a bit more involved.

#### Local development

Todo: See [issue #4][issue-4]

### Pull Requests

Pull requests must follow the goals of:

- Maintainings Paver code and documentation quality
- Being easy to maintain
- Being intuitive easy to use (what is the point of a paved road with potholes)

To that end, the default pull request template includes a number of sections you muct complete before a pull request can be considered for a merge.

Specifically it must have:

1. Documentation
2. Unit tests (if applicable)
3. Not add significant burden to users of the project

That last one is subjective. When it doubt ask for guidance in an issue.

## Styleguides

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
