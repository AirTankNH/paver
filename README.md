# paver
Software development can feel like a trecherous journey through unexplored wilderness. Paving a road through the jungle can create a smooth clearly defined path that helps project teams reach their destination faster and with less risk.

Paver is a serverless bot to help create a Paved Road specifically for developers at design, development, and marketting agencies. It is being built for use at [Airtank][1] to empower a devops culture.

It is inspired by the talk "Full Cycle Developers @Netflix" by Greg Burrell ([â–¶ watch video](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-devops)) with specific tools built in for managing projects at companies that service multiple clients who may have different tech stacks, deployment processes, or even their own accounts.

The goals of Paver are to empower developers to manage their own project lifecycle with no nead to involve an operations team for routine tasks. Tasks that Paver hopes to automate include:

1. Creating new projects (Git repository, code scaffolding, etc)
2. Deploying multiple copies of project stack for development or staging
3. Deploying new code to production (live) environments
4. Tracking, estimating, and reducing costs associated with a stack
